        I come from the automation control system industry, where I discovered the amazing contrast between natural and artificial sparks that have shaped our history and culture. I think that WEB DESIGN is one of the best ways to express the beauty of this contrast, as it blends art and technology in a harmonious way. This inspired me to enroll in She Codes, a program that encourages women to learn how to code and bring a fresh perspective to the tech industry.
